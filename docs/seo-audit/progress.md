## Key baseline (2026-06-01)
- GSC: **Indexed 14 / Not indexed 169** (Discovered-not-indexed 138, Crawled-not-indexed 24,
  404×4, redirect×1, alt-canonical×2).
- Verdict: technical foundation strong; not-indexing driven by authority/crawl-budget + content quality.

## Phase 2 progress (2026-06-04)
All code-side non-defensible claims cleaned across the repo (7 batches, ~700 edits, all tsc-clean,
diffs line-balanced, no encoding corruption):
- C-1 fake review schema · C-2 global retention · C-4a guarantees · C-4b zero-breach · C-4c bug-free
- **C-4d STAT-1** (246 fabricated % + multipliers) · **C-4e STAT-2** (uptime/stability + product stats)
- **STAT-CS/PB, C-8, BUG-1** (animated case studies, progress bars, app-store ratings, stray text)
- **C-4f COUNT** (inflated counts softened, founding-year normalized) · **C-4g SUPER** (superlatives)

**Phase 2 COMPLETE** — CMS-1 done: 8 self-referential claims in 7 Sanity blog posts patched via mutate API (project `mi5m5dun`/`production`) and verified live (no fabricated claims remain).

## Phase 3 progress (2026-06-04)
Technical-SEO fixes done (all tsc-clean, committed): C-5 (real CIM NAP in astro/local-seo JSON-LD),
I-2 (sitemap depth-tiered priorities), M-1 (canonical-doubling guard), I-3 (author archives noindex,follow
+ removed from sitemap), T-1 (301 lowercase→mixed-case slug variants), I-4 (fixed pre-existing
redirect-to-404 on /social-media[-services]). Foundation verified strong in Phase 0 (robots/sitemap/
per-page canonical+metadata+JSON-LD all good). **Remaining:** the 4 GSC "Not found (404)" URLs (need
owner to pull from GSC) for Phase 1 A1; plus owner-verify flags C-7/TEST-1/C-9.

## Phase 4 analysis (2026-06-04) — see `phase4-content-plan.md`
Data-driven audit of all 60 service pages: meta descriptions **all unique** (no templating), `<title>`
**60/60 unique**, structure page-specific (no literal dup), heavy internal linking. **No mechanical
on-page fix needed.** Real gap = **content depth** on the ~12 thinnest pages (perf-marketing ad-platform
sub-pages thinnest at ~660–830 words incl. baseline). Differentiation = content-team task (no fabricated
stats). Biggest indexing ROI remains **Phase 5 off-page authority**. Full plan + thin-page priority list
in `phase4-content-plan.md`.
**Owner-verification flags:** C-7 (cert claims), C-5 (placeholder NAP in JSON-LD → Phase 3), TEST-1
(testimonial authenticity), C-9 (financial claims). Phase 1 still needs the 4 GSC 404 URLs.

## Post-merge DEEP-AUDIT (2026-06-04) — all clean ✅
After `main` merge + production deploy, full re-verification:
- Claims: fabricated %/counts/superlatives/NAP-placeholders = **0** in code (survived merge, no regressions, no conflict markers); **tsc exit 0**.
- Technical fixes intact: sitemap tiers (I-2), author noindex (I-3, live sitemap has 0 author URLs), canonical guard (M-1), slug 301s (T-1), real NAP (C-5).
- Security: `api/setup-sanity` **live returns 403** without secret (API-1 fix deployed & working).
- Sanity: all **8 blog posts still clean** (substring-verified; GROQ `match` gives false positives — ignore).
- Live: robots/sitemap 200; homepage shows "Expert Web Development" (cleaned).
- **NEW finding API-3:** merged Gemini proxy (`ai-commentor/api/generate`) is a public unauthenticated LLM proxy → cost-abuse risk (no auth/rate-limit). Flagged for owner (needs extension-side change).


## Session 2026-06-09 — remaining code items cleared
C-3 (perfect-score claims → near-perfect), API-3 (Gemini proxy optional secret), ANALYTICS-1 (GA4 generate_lead events on all 3 forms), API-2 (honeypot on all 3 forms + route silent-drop). All tsc-clean, committed on `main`. **Only OWNER-VERIFY items remain:** C-7 (certs), TEST-1 (testimonials), C-9 ($ figures) — need owner confirmation, not code. ⚠️ Forms touched — owner should test contact/get-in-touch/careers submit after deploy.

## Session 2026-06-09 (cont.) — OWNER-VERIFY items resolved (owner delegated decision → reframe)
Owner delegated the factual call; applied the conservative/defensible default (unverifiable → soften). One batch, 24 files, diff 43/43 line-balanced, residual-grep 0, no U+FFFD, **tsc exit 0**, committed on `main`.
- **C-7 ✅** — "GDPR/HIPAA/PCI-DSS/SOC 2 certified/compliant" → "-aligned practices" in mobile `WhyChooseUs.tsx`, mobile `Hero.tsx`, **+ `fintech-solutions/page.tsx:86`** (3rd spot caught by residual-grep). Kept deliverable-capability/standards-mapping copy.
- **TEST-1 ✅** — home `Testimonials.tsx`: hard numbers/badges softened ("tripled"→"significantly grew", "10,000+ concurrent users"→"high concurrent traffic", "10K+ Concurrent Users"→"High Concurrency", "200+ hours"→"significant hours", "200+ Hours Saved"→"Significant Hours Saved"). Company names kept; **owner action:** CloudScale.io looks like a placeholder — replace with real anonymized client or remove.
- **C-9 ✅** — all "$50M+/$10M+/$10B+/$2.3M+" + tiktok "50M+ views/500+ videos" → qualitative across ~14 files (stat-cards + metas/JSON-LD + hero copy).
- **Bonus residuals cleaned** (same batch): perf-marketing `WhyChooseUs` "$50M / ROAS 500%"→"Significant…strong average ROAS", "$50M+ Revenue"→"Significant Revenue"; mobile `WhyChooseUs` "95% projects on-time"→"high rate", "35% Higher User Engagement"→"Higher User Engagement", "10,000+ hours A/B"→"extensive A/B testing"; ecommerce `CTA` "35% Avg. Conversion Lift" value→"Higher".

**ALL OWNER-VERIFY items now closed.** No code claim-items remain open. Optional code follow-ups still available: API-3 activation (needs Chrome-extension repo update in tandem) + server-side zod validation on 3 API routes. Owner actions unchanged (deploy, test forms, GSC Request-Indexing, ranking-action-plan).

## Session 2026-06-17 — external schema audit reviewed + founding-year cleanup (C-10, SCHEMA-1)
Owner shared "CIM Structure Schema Audit (12-06-2026)" xlsx + confirmed **founding year = 2025**.
- **Audit verdict:** valid & useful (caught a real live bug) but a few wrong fix-recs (foundingDate→2026 wrong; ios/android "404" mislabeled — pages fine, schema link wrong; "thane→mumbai" not in code).
- **SCHEMA-1 P0 fixed:** mobile hub `page.tsx` JSON-LD ItemList linked to `-services` slugs (live 404) → corrected to `-company` (real pages; live-verified 404→200). foundingDate already 2025 (no change). homepage datePublished 2014→2025.
- **C-10 (big):** founding/experience age claims everywhere contradicted 2025 founding — reframed ~40 spots across 34 files: "12+/10+/15+/30+/8+/5+ years", "since 2014/2015/2010", "three decades/over a decade/decade-long", "Years in Business/Established 2014" → qualitative ("deep/proven/seasoned/combined expertise", "Founded 2025", "Strong/Track Record"). Group A (company-age) + Group B (team/individual-experience) both done. Bonus: residual C-7 "SOC 2 certified solutions"→"-aligned" + C-4b "zero breaches since 2014"→"strong security track record" caught in mobile ServiceOverview.
- Verified: residual sweep 0, no U+FFFD, diff 49/49 line-balanced, **tsc exit 0**, committed on `main`.
- **STILL OPEN (next schema batch):** add JSON-LD to pinterest-marketing + link-building (currently empty); enrich "incomplete" deep sub-pages; fix ItemList/FAQ mismatches (home additional-support, SEO AI-Search/CGE, SMM fb/insta, branding CTA/4-FAQ); career duplicate joblists; harmony-OS 308→200.
