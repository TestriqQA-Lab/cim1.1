            question: "What is cross-platform app development?",
            answer: "Cross-platform app development helps in building mobile applications that are compatible with multiple operating systems, such as iOS and Android, using a single codebase. This approach saves time and reduces costs compared to native development."
        },
        {
            question: "Which is better: Flutter or React Native in 2026?",
            answer: "Both are excellent choices. React Native is ideal if you have an existing web team (JavaScript/React) and complex native dependencies. Flutter is superior for highly branded, custom UI-heavy apps with its Skia rendering engine. We help you choose the best fit during our consulting phase."
        },
        {
            question: "How much does it cost to build a cross-platform app?",
            answer: "The cost varies based on complexity, features, and design. Generally, it is 30-40% cheaper than building two separate native apps. Contact us for a quick quote tailored to your specific project needs."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the benefits of cross-platform vs native development?",
            answer: "Cross-platform offers faster time-to-market, lower costs, and easier maintenance (one codebase to update). Native development is reserved for extremely high-performance games or apps requiring deep, non-standard hardware access. Modern cross-platform frameworks offer near-native performance for 95% of business apps."
        },
        {
            question: "How long does it take to develop a multi-platform mobile app?",
            answer: "A typical MVP (Minimum Viable Product) can be delivered in 3-4 months. More complex enterprise solutions may take 6-8 months. Our agile process ensures you see progress every sprint."
        },
        {
            question: "Can you convert my existing native app to cross-platform?",
            answer: "Yes, we offer Native to cross-platform app conversion services. We can rewrite your iOS or Android app in React Native or Flutter, allowing you to manage a single codebase moving forward."
        },
        {
            question: "Do cross-platform apps support native device features?",
            answer: "Absolutely. Through Platform-Specific Modules and bridges, we can access the camera, GPS, Bluetooth, biometric sensors, and other native hardware features just like a native app."
