            question: "How do I build a professional online portfolio?",
            answer: "Building a professional portfolio starts with strategy. Identify your target audience (employers vs. clients) and curate your best work. We then focus on a clean, responsive design, fast loading speeds, and compelling case studies. We recommend using a platform you own (like a custom Next.js site) rather than relying solely on Behance or Dribbble."

            question: "Why is personal branding important for executives?",
            answer: "In 2026, trust is digital. Personal brand strategy for corporate executives establishes authority, attracts talent to your organization, and opens doors for board seats and speaking engagements. It differentiates you in a crowded market and gives you control over your professional narrative."
        },
        {
            question: "How can I improve my personal brand's search ranking?",
            answer: "Improving rankings requires a mix of technical SEO and content strategy. We focus on optimizing your site for your name, securing high-quality backlinks, creating consistent thought leadership content (blogs/articles), and implementing Schema markup. Brand SERP management is a core part of our service."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the best platforms for a personal portfolio website?",
            answer: "While builders like Squarespace are okay for beginners, the \"best\" platform for growth is a custom-coded solution (using React, Vue, or Next.js) or a headless CMS. This offers superior speed, SEO control, and design flexibility. For personal website for academic and research professionals, we often recommend solutions that handle publications and CVs effectively."
