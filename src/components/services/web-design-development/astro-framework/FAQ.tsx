        },
        {
            question: "How much does it cost to build a custom Astro.js website?",
            answer: "Astro website costs vary by scope: Simple Marketing Site (5-10 pages) costs $3,000-$8,000 taking 2-3 weeks; Content-Rich Blog/Portfolio (20-50 pages) costs $8,000-$15,000 taking 3-5 weeks; E-commerce Catalog (100+ products) costs $15,000-$30,000 taking 5-8 weeks; Documentation Portal (500+ pages) costs $20,000-$40,000 taking 6-10 weeks; Enterprise Multi-Site Platforms start at $40,000+ taking 10-16 weeks."

        {
            question: "How do I choose the best Astro development agency?",
            answer: "Choose an Astro development agency based on: 1) Proven track record with 5+ live Astro projects and PageSpeed reports, 2) Technical expertise with team certifications and framework proficiency, 3) Performance portfolio with Core Web Vitals data, 4) Industry experience in your domain, 5) Process transparency with clear communication and code reviews, 6) Support SLA with maintenance and ongoing support availability."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the difference between Astro.js and Next.js?",
            answer: "Astro.js outputs static HTML with zero JavaScript by default, achieving 98-100 PageSpeed scores and <1s load times, ideal for content sites, blogs, and marketing pages. Next.js is JavaScript-heavy with React runtime, achieving 85-95 PageSpeed and 1-3s load times, best for dynamic apps and SaaS. Astro bundles are 10-50 KB vs Next.js 200-500 KB, resulting in lower hosting costs and better SEO."
        },
        {
            question: "How long does it take to develop an Astro.js web application?",
            answer: "Development timelines vary by complexity: Small projects (5-10 pages) take 3-4 weeks, Medium projects (20-50 pages) take 6-8 weeks, Large projects (100+ pages) take 12-14 weeks, Enterprise projects (multi-site platforms) take 16-20 weeks. Most Astro projects launch 30% faster than React/Next.js equivalents due to simplified build processes."
        },
        {
            question: "Can Astro handle e-commerce and dynamic content?",
            answer: "Yes!

Dynamic content is handled through user authentication with islands (React/Vue), forms with validation, real-time data via server endpoints, and personalized content."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you offer ongoing Astro maintenance and support?",
